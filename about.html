            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I’m Rubasri, a passionate web developer with a deep love for coding and creating interactive websites. My journey in the tech world began with a fascination for how things work behind the scenes, and that curiosity has evolved into a career where I bring digital ideas to life.</p>
            <p>I specialize in crafting beautiful, functional, and responsive websites. With expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS, I build user-centric web applications that are not only visually appealing but also perform seamlessly across various devices.</p>
            <p>Coding is more than just a skill for me; it's a passion. I thrive on solving problems and exploring new technologies to enhance user experiences. Whether it's implementing a new feature or optimizing existing code, I approach every project with enthusiasm and precision.</p>
            <p>I believe that the best websites are those that engage users through intuitive design and interactive elements. I love creating dynamic interfaces and animations that make browsing a delight. From responsive layouts to real-time interactions, I aim to make every user’s journey enjoyable and memorable.
